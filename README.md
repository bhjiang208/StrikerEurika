Here is a bried introdution of what each part of codes does.
1. constants
   This is the most simple one. It includes basic physical constants
2. basic_cal
   The name is its function. It includes all kinds of basic calculations that functions in neutral and photochemicla use as helper methods
3. data_loader
   The name is its function. It upload all datas including radiation flux and cross section of all photochemical reactions. Also, it revise part of the data so that other methods can use them directly.
4. photochemical
   All photochemical reactions
5. neutral
   All reactions apart from photochemical
6. Trappist_main
   Main part. Simulate reactions and produce final graphs.

If you want to ran the codes, please remember to change the position link of data files
